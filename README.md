python3 main.py
```

1. **Score**: 1 point for every brick broken
2. **Lives**: 3 lives, one lost every time the ball falls below the paddle
3. **Board**: is randomly generated
4. **Paddle**: Ball reflects off of paddle based on where it hit the paddle
5. **Bricks**: Regular bricks: cycle through three levels - Blue > Yellow > Orange - before breaking. Unbreakable bricks are Grey.
